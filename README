SYNOPSIS

This is a game developed using HTML5\JS and the Canvas tag. On the backend we
will be using PHP\MySQL. Back end will consist of save states, transactions, and
loading game content.

GRAPHICS

Currently using sprites from Ultima: Quest of the Avatar for the NES. My
personal favorite. If development continues I plan on paying someone to create
sprites that are more 16/32bit generation.

SOUND

Nothing as of now. Chiptunes will probably be used until after professional
sprites are acquired.

INPUT

Mappable.

STORY

Soloing it for now.

LENGTH

Long.
